**This project for counting numbers includes three types of counters:**
1. TAP ME! - This counter works when you press the Tab key. It will count numbers.
2. Close! - Use this counter for closed cases and items. The CLOSE counter works when you press the **A key**.
3. DELAY! - Use this counter for delay cases and items. The DELAY counter works when you press the **L key**.

**FEATURES OF THE COUNTER:**
•  There is no login option; you can use it without signing up.

•  If you have counted numbers and need to save them, it works in auto mode. The counts will be saved automatically, and you can see the count next time.
•  One Reset button will work on all counters.

**NOT VALID:**
•  If you have counted numbers and need to see the same count on another system, it will not work because there is no signup option to save the data with an ID.
